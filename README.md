Tug Of War
========

Demonstration game for JAM379 to be delivered at the BlackBerry 10 European Launch - Feb 2013

Description
---
This is a traditional Tug of War game where two teams pull on a rope in opposite directions. The team which pulls the hardest wins.

The game is designed to be played with an audience which is split into two teams who compete against each other.

Setup
---
This version of the game requires the BlackBerry device to be connected to a WiFi network. The players must be connected to the same WiFi network. Players can 'tug' the rope using their phone or laptop by opening a connection to the BlackBerry's IP address on port 8080 for Team A or port 8081 for Team B. The easiest way to do this is by opening a web browser. 

As soon as a connection is received the rope is 'tugged' for that team. The team which is able to pull the centre of the rope (marked by a red ribbon) off the screen is the winner (although there is no win detection yet implemented).
